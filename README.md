## Description
Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package - what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Installation
The application will be invoked by using the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```
